      - Marlo: You'd still have me? Even after all of this?
      - Chai: I will. We could even go somewhere new. Start fresh. Together. What do you say?

      - Alvin: Guys! What's going on? Bam, you just ran off after blowing up on me out of nowhere and Bruce, what's with the bags?
      - Bam: I told you to mind your own business, pal! Now, get lost!
      - Bruce: This doesn't concern you, Alvin. Move along. Or better yet, just resign! You never should have won the election in the first place.
      - Alvin: That's what all this is about? The election?
      - Bruce: Of course it's about the election. Marlo and me had a plan. We were going to get rich while bringing Camden into the 21st century.
      - Bam: If you don't step down and get lost, we'll dump these weeds into the island's drinking water and then Marlo will turn everyone against you!

      - Bam: You should have just minded your own business!
      - Bruce: Get lost, Alvin. Or better yet, resign. Marlo should have won that election, not you!
      - Alvin: Is that what this is about? You're both upset that I won?
      - Bruce: Of course we're upset! We had a plan, Alvin! We were going to work with Marlo to bring Camden into the 21st century!
      - Bam: And make a lot of money...
      - Bruce: Once these weeds mix with Camden's drinking water, Marlo will have the whole island under his control. He'll turn everyone against you!

      - Bam: Back off, Alvin.
      - Bruce: Yeah, just walk away. Or better yet, resign!
      - Alvin: What are you talking about? Guys, I thought we were friends. I don't understand what's going on. Why are you doing this?
      - Bruce: Marlo and me had a plan. We were going to bring Camden into the 21st century, but now that's all ruined because of you!
      - Bam: Once we mix these weeds with the island's drinking water, then Marlo will have everyone under his control. Everyone will turn against you!
      - Bruce: The only way we'll stop is if you agree to resign. The choice is yours, Alvin. Think quickly or else our hands might just slip.

      - Alvin: Goldie! Hey! Are you okay? You guys need to leave her alone! She's go nothing to do with any of this.
      - Marlo: This is really all your fault, Alvin. You sent her off on her own and now she's paying the price for your laziness. Resign. Now!
      - Ban: Yeah, or else we'll toss her in the lake along with all the weeds and she'll be the first to turn against you!
      - Alvin: Marlo... This isn't right. You know that. Is this... It this what Chai would have wanted?
      - Marlo: Chai wants someone with power, prestige. When you won the election, you all but shattered what remained between us. It's your fault!
      - Chai: No, Marlo! You're wrong!
      - Marlo: Wha! Where did you come from? How much did you hear?
      - Chai: I heard everything. My bakery is literally right there. Marlo, I never cared about power. I just wanted you to be more present with me.
      - Bruce: Don't listen to her, Marlo! We have an agreement!
      - Marlo: Hush! Chai... You'd still be willing to make things work between us? Even after everything I've done?
      - Chai: Yes. Yes, I would. We could even go somewhere new. We could start fresh. Together. What do you say, Marlo? Will you give us another chance?

      - Alvin: Marlo, stop! Please reconsider. Is this... Is this what Chai would have wanted?
      - Marlo: Chai wants someone who has power. When you won the election, you all but ruined my chances of ever working things out with Chai!
      - Chai: You're wrong, Marlo!
      - Marlo: Wha! Where did you come from? How much have you heard?
      - Chai: I heard everything. My bakery is literally right there. Marlo, I never cared about power. I only wanted you to be more present with me.

      - Marlo: I appreciate that. Well, uh, take care.
      - Alvin: You as well. Goodbye.
      - Goldie: Aren't you worried about Chai? With how far Marlo was willing to go, I can't imagine that he'll be all that kind to her.

      - Alvin: Breathe, Chai. We'll get everything sorted out.
      - Chai: Alvin, Wilbur said that Marlo swore to get revenge. If he survived the cash... He might try to come back. He can't come back!
